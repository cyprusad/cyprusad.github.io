# saiwarang.com

Hello nice people of the internet!

I am Sai Warang and I live in Canada. I really like it here. I work at Shopify. 

This is the code for my personal website. I am using Left framework generously open-sourced by [@holman](https://github.com/holman). Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). I might change this someday with my newly acquired Sketch & front-end skills. 

## Deployment

This website is deployed with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)

## Licensing
